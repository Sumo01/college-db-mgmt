2. Apache web server- https://www.apachelounge.com/download/
   Installation  and hosting- https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/Install-Apache-Web-Server-24-Windows-10-ServerRoot-Error#:~:text=Step%20by%20step%20Apache%20install%20on%20Windows&text=Download%20the%20installation%20media%20in,run%20the%20httpd.exe%20command
3. mySQL community edition - https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/


After downloading and installing Mysql with the required connectors (Only mySQL command line is needed do not need mySQL for VSCode- will give error as it needs VSCode 2019)

------Hosting on Apache----------
1. Once you have downloaded and extracted the zip file for the windows download, copy the Apache24 folder and paste it in your C: drive
2. Go to C:\Apache24\conf\httpd- open using notepad
3. Search for the command #ServerName www.example.com:80
4. Uncomment (Remove #) and write your custom server name in place of www.example.com:80. In this project, we have used localhost
5. Open CommandPrompt and write the following code:
      cd C:\Apache24\bin
      httpd.exe
6. Go to your browser and type in localhost (or your custom server name) and it should open a page saying it works.
7. Copy the projectSE folder and go to C:\Apache\bin\htdocs and paste the folder there. 
8. Now, go to CollegeDBMgmtStartPage.html in htdocs and open that from the htdocs folder. 
9. This should get the project started. 
10. Make sure to make the tables and add values in mySQL otherwise the backend will not be up. Go to SQLCode for the same.
